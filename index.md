# Showcasing Strengths

-Developing the ePortfolio has improved my coding skills and taught me a lot about data structures, algorithms, and full-stack development.
-I learned how to effectively incorporate computer science principles to solve a given problem.
-For example, in my ePortfolio, I used a quicksort algorithm that facilitates the sorting of any column the user clicks on. Quicksort is known to be an efficient algorithm, which is important, especially when dealing with larger datasets.
-Also, I learned how to use a MySQL database to store and interact with data.
-I learned how to connect to the database and display the data in a webpage.
-I learned how to implement CRUD operations, which allow me to use programs, such as Postman, to create, read, update, and delete entries from the database.
-In the program, I learned how to effectively collaborate in a team environment. 
-After my studies at SNHU, I learned that the agile method is very effective for communication and collaboration.
-The agile method emphasizes continuous testing and feedback, which allows issues to be identified early. This is helpful because identifying a problem in a later phase would make it much more difficult to fix. 
-In the program, I also learned about communicating with stakeholders.
-It is important to completely understand stakeholdersâ€™ requirements and ask for clarification immediately if something is unclear.
-It is also important to continuously communicate with stakeholders, and let them know of any issues or changes.
-It is important for the stakeholders and the developers to understand the cost, scope, and time. 
-I learned a lot about the importance of data structures and algorithms. I learned about all kinds of data structures in this program, such as arrays, linked lists, binary trees, graphs, and maps. It is important to know all of them because they have different strengths and weaknesses and, in some situations, one data structure may work much better than another.
-This program has taught me a lot about software engineering. I learned many programming languages and development various types of projects. I learned C++, Python, Java, JavaScript and HTML. I also developed full-stack webpages using VS Code and mobile apps using Android Studio. I also created 3D objects in OpenGL. 
-I learned about databases and how to incorporate them into a program. I learned about SQL and NoSQL databases and used MySQL and MongoDB in my courses. 
-I learned about software security, and the different types of risks. For example, this program taught me the various strategies attackers use, such as SQL injection, brute force attacks, Denial-of-Service attacks, and Cross-Site Scripting. I learned about strategies to mitigate the risk of attacks such as these. I also learned about the importance of staying up-to-date with security and using the latest security standards.
